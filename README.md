# Face Detection Application

This application leverages **ML Kit** and **TensorFlow Lite** for real-time face detection, offering both automatic and manual capture options. Built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, it follows the **MVVM architecture** with **Hilt** for dependency injection, ensuring a seamless and robust user experience.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Automatic face detection using ML Kit.
- **Manual Capture**: Allows users to manually capture up to three faces.
- **Face Validation**: Ensures accuracy with TensorFlow Lite.
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with MVVM and Hilt for clean code and scalability.
- **State-of-the-Art UI**: Developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- **Reliable Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for `FaceAnalyzer` and utility classes.
